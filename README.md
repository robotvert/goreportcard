# Go Report Card - CLI style

The upstream project is a full fledged web app but I only need to run it locally, on a given package's source code.

This Quick n' Dirtyâ„¢ variant keeps only the bare minimum code (no mongo caching, no http handlers etc.).
Some changes were made accordingly, while trying to keep those minimal.


## SETUP

To run properly several tools need to be installed, using the following commands:

```
go get -u github.com/fzipp/gocyclo

go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet

go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
```
